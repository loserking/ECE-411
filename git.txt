/* A Cheat sheet for doing branching operations with GIT*/


git branch                           - shows all current branches
git branch <branch name>             - creates a local branch with the specified name
git checkout -b <branch name>        - creates and switches to a local branch with the specified name (replaces doing git branch and then a git checkout)
git checkout <branch name>           - switches to the branch name specified 

Once on the new local branch, make changes as needed and commit often. You can also use git push -u origin <branch name> to push up the branch to the repository.

git merge <branch>                   - merges the current branch with the other branch. Most often this will be used while on master and merging your branch back into master. EX: git merge test1 -This will merge test1 into the master.

Once the branch is merged, use : git push -u origin master       to push the merged code onto the repository.

Once the branch is merged and pushed up. You can delete the branch using: git branch -d <branchname>  - This will ONLY delete the branch if it has no unmerged changes. MAKE SURE TO USE LOWERCASE d. DO NOT USE UPPERCASE D.
